# ============================================
# Docker Ignore File
# ============================================
# Similar to .gitignore, this tells Docker which files
# to EXCLUDE when copying files into the container.
#
# Why? Because COPY . . copies EVERYTHING, including
# files we don't want in our container:
#   - node_modules (we npm install inside the container)
#   - .env files (contain secrets!)
#   - test files (not needed in production)
#   - uploads (user data shouldn't be baked into the image)
# ============================================

# Dependencies - installed fresh inside the container
node_modules
npm-debug.log*

# Environment files - contain secrets!
# These should be injected at runtime, not baked into the image
.env
.env.*
.env.local
.env.test

# Upload directory - user data should use volumes, not the image
uploads/*
!uploads/.gitkeep

# Test files - not needed in production
src/__tests__
coverage
jest.config.js
.env.test

# IDE and OS files
.vscode
.idea
*.swp
*.swo
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Git
.git
.gitignore

# Docker files (don't copy docker config into itself)
Dockerfile
docker-compose.yml
.dockerignore

# Documentation (not needed to run the app)
*.md
LICENSE
