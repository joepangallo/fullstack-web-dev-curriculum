# Railway Deployment Configuration
# ============================================
# Railway is a platform for deploying web apps.
# This file tells Railway how to build and run your app.
#
# Railway alternatives: Render, Fly.io, Heroku
# Each has its own config format, but the concepts are similar.
#
# Documentation: https://docs.railway.com/reference/config-as-code

[build]
# Use the Dockerfile for building
builder = "DOCKERFILE"
# Path to the Dockerfile (relative to this file)
dockerfilePath = "./Dockerfile"

[deploy]
# Number of instances to run (1 for hobby projects)

# Health check endpoint - Railway pings this to verify the app is running
healthcheckPath = "/api/health"
# How long to wait for the health check (in seconds)
healthcheckTimeout = 100
# Restart policy: on-failure means restart if the app crashes
restartPolicyType = "ON_FAILURE"
# Maximum restarts before giving up
