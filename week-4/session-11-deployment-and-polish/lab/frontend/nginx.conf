# ============================================
# Nginx Configuration for Single-Page Application (SPA)
# ============================================
# This configuration solves a critical problem with SPAs:
#
# Problem: React Router handles URLs like /tasks, /login, /profile
# on the client side. But if a user refreshes the page at /tasks,
# the browser asks Nginx for a file called "tasks" - which doesn't
# exist! Nginx would return a 404 error.
#
# Solution: Configure Nginx to serve index.html for ALL routes.
# React Router will then look at the URL and render the right page.
#
# This is called "history mode" or "HTML5 history API" routing.
# ============================================

server {
    # Listen on port 80 (standard HTTP port)
    listen 80;

    # Server name - underscore means "match all"
    # In production, you'd use your actual domain name
    server_name _;

    # Where the built React files are stored
    root /usr/share/nginx/html;

    # Default file to serve
    index index.html;

    # ============================================
    # SPA Routing: The Key Configuration
    # ============================================
    # try_files checks for files in order:
    #   1. $uri         - Try the exact URL as a file (e.g., /assets/main.js)
    #   2. $uri/        - Try the URL as a directory
    #   3. /index.html  - If nothing found, serve index.html (let React handle it)
    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }

    # ============================================
    # API Proxy (Optional)
    # ============================================
    # If your frontend and backend are on the same domain,
    # proxy API requests to the backend server.
    # Uncomment and configure if needed:
    #
    # location /api/ {
    #     proxy_pass http://backend:3001;
    #     proxy_http_version 1.1;
    #     proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    #     proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
    #     proxy_set_header Host $host;
    #     proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    #     proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    #     proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    # }

    # ============================================
    # Caching for Static Assets
    # ============================================
    # Vite adds content hashes to file names (e.g., main.a1b2c3.js)
    # so we can cache them aggressively. If the content changes,
    # the filename changes, and the browser fetches the new version.

    # Cache JS, CSS, and image files for 1 year
    location ~* \.(js|css|png|jpg|jpeg|gif|ico|svg|woff|woff2|ttf|eot)$ {
        expires 1y;
        add_header Cache-Control "public, immutable";
    }

    # Don't cache index.html (it references the hashed asset files)
    # If we cached index.html, users might get stale references
    location = /index.html {
        add_header Cache-Control "no-cache";
    }

    # ============================================
    # Security Headers
    # ============================================
    # These headers improve security by preventing common attacks

    # Prevent MIME type sniffing (stops browser from guessing file types)
    add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff" always;

    # Prevent clickjacking (stops your site from being embedded in iframes)
    add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN" always;

    # Enable XSS protection in older browsers
    add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block" always;

    # ============================================
    # Gzip Compression
    # ============================================
    # Compress responses to reduce bandwidth
    # A 500KB JS file might compress to ~100KB
    gzip on;
    gzip_types text/plain text/css application/json application/javascript text/xml application/xml text/javascript image/svg+xml;
    gzip_min_length 1000;
}
